      <h2> Experience </h2>
      <ol>
        <li> I worked at Kmart and work as customer service for almost one year.<br /> Through that, I gained experience working in big group.</li>
        <br />
        <li> During my 2nd year at ASU, I volunteered to be one of the counselor for E2 camp.<br />
            I was one of the small group leader where my responsibility was to guide freshmen engineer students with thier projects and thier <br />schedule through out the day.
            I improve my leadership skills with this oppertunity to lead a group of engineering students to improve <br /> thier building skills.
            Which in the end, my small group won a small compitition at the end of the E2 camp; not only did I gain more <br /> leadership skills but my group also gain building skills as the result of participating at E2 camp.</li>
